# fargo
Hi! My name is Pedro Barros and I've developed this website as a self-tought project.

The goal was to explore and get acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery) tecnhologies, while manipulating RSS feeds (in XML).
During a collegue course, me and a collegue of mine developed an ASP.NET project similar to this one.
However, in order to explore new tools (for me, anyway), I decided to implement parts of that project, and the result was FARGo.
FARGo intends to be a funnier way to reed RSS feeds. For me, someone who likes pop culture news, especially everything concerning cinema, this website represents a much engageding alternative to all plain and boring rss feed readers out there.

Long story short, building this website allowed me to make good use of my downtime by developing new skills.
